# CitRad - Citizen Science Traffic Radar 

Here you find all the sources about how to build our traffic counter radar system.

For the hardware and software of the CitRad Radar Sensor Unit, please continue to [Software README](Software/README.md) or [Hardware README](Hardware/README.md).

## FabLab-Cottbus Project Resources

We have further and more general information on our [project page](https://community.fablab-cottbus.de/t/ueber-das-cityradar-projekt/453). Discussions about the prototype development you find [here](https://community.fablab-cottbus.de/t/cityradar-teensy-prototyp/492/9). Also we have a separate discussion page about the [development of the casing](https://community.fablab-cottbus.de/t/gehaeusebau-fuer-die-radarsensorelektronik/507).

## Archive

In the beginning we started to develop a low noise amplifier for the radar module that we didn't need in the end. You find all about this in the [low-noise-amplifier branch](https://github.com/fablabcb/CityRadar/tree/low-noise-amplifier) and on the [discussion page in our forum](https://community.fablab-cottbus.de/t/citrad-elektronik-entwicklung/454)
